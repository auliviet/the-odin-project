## Instructions

The full set of instructions can be found at [The Odin Project ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

- Create a page 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript and place it within a container on the page.
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid

## Extra credits

- Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.
- Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square.
