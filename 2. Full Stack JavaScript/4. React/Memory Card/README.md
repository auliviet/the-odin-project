## Project Overview

The Cital is a game of Rick. Select each Rick only once, not twice. It is built using React and Typescript with Vite for build. The goal of the exercise is to create React components and manage asynchronous code with React Effects.

This project offers the below functionalities:

- Get the images and content via an API.
- Use sound effects and CSS animations.
- Use [Vite](https://vite.dev/) to bundle the source files and build the project.

## Instructions
