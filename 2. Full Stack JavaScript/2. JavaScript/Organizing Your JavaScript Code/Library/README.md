## Project Overview

My Library lets users save the list of books in their library and if the book has been read or not.

This project offers the below functionalities:

- Adding a new book, its author, number of pages and if it has been read or not.
- Deleting a book from the library.
- Updating the reading status of a book.
- The page comes pre-populated with some books as an example.
- All the data is saved in an array in JavaScript. The data is lost on refreshing the page.
