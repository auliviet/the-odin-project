## Project Overview

BATTLE/SHIP is a simple game played within the browser using vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with unit testing using Jest.

This project offers the below functionalities:

- Allow players to play against the computer a game of Battleship.
- Use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle the source files.
- Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.

## Instructions

The full set of instructions can be found at [The Odin Project ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship).

- Create a Ship class that includes their length, the number of times they’ve been hit and whether or not they’ve been sunk.
- Create a Gameboard class to place ships at specific coordinates, receive attack, keep track of the missed attacks and report if all ships have been sunk.
- Create a Player class that keeps track of either the player is real or a computer.
- Drive the game using event listeners to interact with your objects.
- Optional:
  -- implement drag and drop to allow players to place their ships.
  -- create a 2-player option that lets users take turns by passing the laptop back and forth, or by spinning the monitor around on a desktop.
  -- polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.

# Future enhancements

- Allow players to select a difficulty for the computer.
- Allow players to manually place their ship.
- Allow players to play against another real player.
