## Project Overview

Do I need an Umbrella? provides weather forecast for a specified location by querying the [Visualcrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com) API.

This project offers the below functionalities:

- Current weather for a specified location (including chances of rain, humidity, sunrise and sunset).
- 7-days forecast for a specified location.
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
- Source code has two option to querry the API (Promises and Async/Await) to get familiar with both methods.
- Background color of the page changes based on the weather forecast and time of the day.
- Answer the simple question "Do I need an umbrella today"?
- Use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle the source files.

## Instructions

The full set of instructions can be found at [The Odin Project ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

- Write the functions that hit the API (functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location).
- Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info.
- Display the information on your webpage!
- Add any styling you like!
- Optional:
  -- add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
