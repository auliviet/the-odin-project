# Algorithms and Data Structures

[The Oding Project](https://www.theodinproject.com): Algorithms and Data Structures.
Exercise as part of the Full-stack JavaScript curriculum on computer science principles.

## Project Overview

Different exercises to get familiar with Computer Science concepts (ie. recursions, Big O notation, time complexity and space complexity) and practice the implementation of common data structures.

## Instructions

- Recursions (Fibonacci sequence and Mergesort): [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)
- Linked lists: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)
- HashMap: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap)
- Binary Search Tree: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees)
- Knights Travails: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails)

## Future enhancements
