## Project Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game created by using Factory Functions to manage the game loop, keep track of scores and render the content on the page.

This project offers the below functionalities:

- Two players get to chose their name.
- Each player in turn place their mark on a three by three grid.
- To win, a player must align (vertically, horizontally or in diagonal)

## Instructions

- Create a Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser.
- Store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object.
- Players will be stored in an object as well.
- The main goal here is to have as little global code as possible.
  -- Try tucking as much as you can inside factories.
  -- Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects.
